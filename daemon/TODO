Distinct variable space: commands vs windows
Pass window variables in env
Window filter configuration
Window matching heuristic
Reorder non-exported procedures
Set command order property on start/stop
Window startup iteration counter

Assign user commands a higher stack order than windows => No, only automate when not busy

Reset should trigger automation (otherwise, when no commands are started, automation is not called automatically)
Reset should kill windows, too => Debatable
